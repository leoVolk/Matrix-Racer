## Information

A unity project of an infinite pipe racer, made at the start of my Unity learning progress. 
It builds a continious pipe with obstacles inside around the player. 

Model and animation taken from [mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com)

## Controlls

Use W/D to rotate inside the pipe.
When build for mobile, tap the left side of the screen to rotate left, the right side to rotate right.
